# Cloudflare-HTTP-Log-Analysis-using-Splunk
This project walks you through analyzing Cloudflare HTTP Request Logs to separate normal traffic from malicious activity. You’ll ingest the JSONL dataset, use field-aware SPL on ClientIP, URI, QueryString, Status, UserAgent, CacheStatus, WAFAction, RayID, and also practice parsing an embedded raw record with spath for flexible extraction.
